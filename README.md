# **Background**
## Description of the Two Sample T-Test
The two sample t-test was first created by William Sealy Gosset in 1908. The two sample t-test, also coined by the term ‘Student’s t-test’, is able to determine whether two populations means are equal to one another (Sun, 2020). 

## Hypotheses of the Two Sample T-Test
The hypotheses for the two sample t-test is typically written as follows:
H0: μ1 = μ2
Ha: μ1 ≠ μ2,  Ha: μ1 > μ2, or  Ha: μ1 < μ2.   

# **Method Scope**
## Formula for the Two Sample T-Test
The formula below is written under the assumption that the variances are equal:
T = (X - Y) - (μx - μy) Sp1n+ 1m
The ‘n’ and ‘m’ values are the sample sizes and the Sp value is found through the given formula:
Sp = (n - 1) S2x + (m - 1)S2yn + m - 2

	If the variances are not equal, then the formula would be written as such:
T = (X - Y) - (μx - μy) S2xn + S2ym

## Test Statistics and P-value Interpretation
Once the T statistic is found, we can then compare it to the critical value derived from the t distribution. With the given alternative hypothesis, we will form a critical region. This process is illustrated in the table below:

**Alernative Hypothesis** | **Rejection Region**
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Seconds | 301 | 283 | 290 | 286 | 289 | 285 | 287 | 287 | 272 | 276 | 269
--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
