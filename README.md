# **Background**
## **Description of the Two Sample T-Test**
The two sample t-test was first created by William Sealy Gosset in 1908. The two sample t-test, also coined by the term ‘Student’s t-test’, is able to determine whether two populations means are equal to one another (Sun, 2020). 

## **Hypotheses of the Two Sample T-Test**
The hypotheses for the two sample t-test is typically written as follows:
H0: μ1 = μ2
Ha: μ1 ≠ μ2,  Ha: μ1 > μ2, or  Ha: μ1 < μ2.
